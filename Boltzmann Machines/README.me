# Deep-Learning, Boltzmann Machine
Using a boltzman machine to create a movie recommender system

This program takes as input a database of movies users have watched. It then uses a boltzman machine algorithm to make the associations with what movies users tend to watch together. Using that, it is able to predict what other movies a user may like to watch.
