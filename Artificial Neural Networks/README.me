Using an Artificial Neural Network to predict customer churn at a bank

This program takes as input a database of with information about bank customers and if they left the bank. The program then analyzes the different variables that describe each customer and trains them against if they stayed or left the bank. Using this information, the program is able to train an ANN to predict if customers are likely to stay or leave the bank.
