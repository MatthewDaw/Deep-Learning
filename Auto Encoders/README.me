# Deep-Learning, Auto Encoders
Using an auto-encoder to compress user ratings for different movies.

This program takes as input users rating for different movies and creates a Neural Network that can output it to itself. The network does not have very many nodes so it can be saved and using the weights one can get a reasonable extraction of what the data was. This in effect creates a type of data compression.
