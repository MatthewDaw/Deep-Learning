#Deep Learning, Recurrent Neural Network
Recurrent Neural Network that predicts stock prices one day ahead

This program takes as input stock prices. It then looks at the data day by day and considers a defined block of days and uses those days for input into a recurrent neural network and gives a prediction for the next day.

Note: while the recurrent neural function is implemented correctly the stock market is too chaotic for it to learn effectively. As such, the output is only slightly better than completely random guesses. The program then is by no means production-ready and there really is no way to make production-ready without stacking other algorithms with it.
