#Deep Learning, Self Organizing Maps
Self organizing map to detect potential fraud in credit card applicants.

This algorithm takes for input data banks have aboud their credit card applicants. It then analyzes and creates a heatmap to indiciate how much different groups are diverging from the rest. The assumption motivating this study is that groups who diverge the most are the most likely to have some sort of fraudulent activity. If a group has "zero" divergence then their box will be the darkest color and if they have "one" divergence then the box will be light. For additional context, green boxes indicate if members of a group have gotten their credit card approved and red circles indicate that their card was rejected.
